# NOTE: Enable this as you need to get migrations working in your deployed
# (i.e. Production) environments. Match the condition check to what you have in
# the Dockerfile CMD. I use puma in the production.Dockerfile as that's the
# recommended option by the Puma team (https://github.com/puma/puma#rails), but
# the default Rails Dockerfile uses `./bin/rails server`
#
# If running the rails server then create or migrate existing database
# if [ "${*}" == "./bin/rails server" ]; then
#   ./bin/rails db:prepare
# fi
